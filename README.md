This library aims at exposing low levels utilities that make creating custom and performant animations easier in React. We're focusing on *possibilites* for now.

However, this lib might gather some higher level utilities too in order to make the whole thing more *useful*.

The underlying concept is [FLIP](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/).

## Usage

The documentation is currently being worked on.

But you can still look after `src/ReactFlipContainer.test.js` or dig in the demos that will spawn in the next few days.

## Contribution

Feel free to open any issue if you're curious about the project and want to know more.
